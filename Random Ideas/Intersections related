# Check If Two Segments Intersect

Figuring out whether two segments `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` intersect? Here's a quick trick!

## Steps to Check:
1. Calculate:
   - `x = max(a, c)`
   - `y = min(b, d)`

2. **Interpretation:**
   - If `x > y`: **No intersection**  
   - Else: **They intersect**

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Segments:** `(1, 5)` and `(2, 8)`  
- `x = max(1, 2) = 2`  
- `y = min(5, 8) = 5`  
- Since `x < y`: **They intersect!** ðŸŽ‰  

### Example 2:
**Segments:** `(2, 5)` and `(5, 10)`  
- `x = max(2, 5) = 5`  
- `y = min(5, 10) = 5`  
- Since `x == y`: **They intersect!** ðŸŽ‰  

### Example 3:
**Segments:** `(1, 3)` and `(5, 10)`  
- `x = max(1, 5) = 5`  
- `y = min(3, 10) = 3`  
- Since `x > y`: **No intersection.** ðŸš«

## Why This Works  
The logic ensures we only check the overlap between the ranges of the two segments. Quick and efficient! ðŸš€
